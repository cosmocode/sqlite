Sqlite Plugin for DokuWiki

A helper plugin to easily access a SQLite database.

The plugin detects whether PHPs PDO extension is available otherwise it 
will look for the PHP sqlite extension.
PDO supports sqlite3 only, and this plugin will look for db files with extension *.sqlite3
The sqlite extension supports sqlite2 only, here this plugin will look for  *.sqlite .
The admin interface shows a convert button when your database has the sqlite2 format
and your installation has the both sqlite extensions else you should upgrade manually
your database to sqlite3 format.

Manually upgrade can by using commandline tools. Database files are in data/meta directory.
    sqlite databasename.sqlite .dump | sqlite3 databasename.sqlite3
More about this upgrade on http://www.sqlite.org/version3.html
